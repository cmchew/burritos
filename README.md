Write a program that will allow a robot to assemble 25 burritos. Use a random generator for each burrito option and build a list of 25 burrito customization:

Rice: white, brown, none, all
Meat: chicken, steak, carnidas, chorizo, sofritas, veggie meat, none, all
Beans: pinto, black, none, all
Salsa: mild, medium, hot, non
Veggies: lettuce, fajita veggies, none, all
Cheese: yes/no
Guac: yes/no
Queso: yes/no
Sour cream: yes/no

Randomly generate a number of ingredients per burrito. Each burrito should have a minimum of 5 ingredients and a maximum of 9 ingredients. Save the finished burritos and display the contents.

Calculate and display a price for each burrito. Pricing will be $3.00 plus 0.50 for each additional ingredient. So a burrito without any ingredients will be $3.00. Also, add $0.50 for "all" but for "none" or "no" add $0 .
